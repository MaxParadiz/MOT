```math
n \rightarrow \pi^*$ in 4,4-Dimethoxy s-tetrazine (HOMO -> LUMO)
```

```math
\sigma \rightarrow \sigma^* if H_2 (HOMO -> LUMO)

Given a molecule, it will generate an animation depicting the wave function of an electron as it undergoes a Rabi cycle that moves the electron from one orbital into another.
This can be useful for obtaining a visual representation of a simple electronic excitation in which the first excited state is well described by a single configuration, such as a HOMO -> LUMO transition. 

This small program is meant to be an educational tool. It is written in a way that should allow you to adapt it to your particular needs. This program depends only on FOSS software.
