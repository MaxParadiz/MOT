Animate molecular orbital transitions using Psi4 and Blender

Author: Maximilian Paradiz Dominguez, University of Amsterdam


Given a molecule, it will generate an animation depicting the wave function of an electron as it undergoes a Rabi cycle that moves the electron from the HOMO into the LUMO.
This can be useful for obtaining a visual representation of a simple electronic excitation in which the first excited state is well described by a single configuration (HOMO -> LUMO). 

This small program is meant to be an educational tool. It is written in a way that should allow you to adapt it to your particular needs. This program depends only on FOSS software.
